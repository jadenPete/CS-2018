            <h3>Introduction</h3>

            <p>
              Welcome to our website! We are students of Mr. Pointer's Computer Science class.
              For the past few months, we've learned a great deal of information and have experienced
              incredible opportunities that we'd like to share with you.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the beginning of the year, we focused on problem-solving in preparation for the
              remaining year. During this unit, we studied various computer-related problems and
              processes. These include mathematics, fundamental algorithms, binary, data awareness,
              communication, and studying habits, tower building, and spanning trees.
            </p>

            <p>
              After we established a baseline, we moved on to basic electronics through the FLiP
              Try-it Kit by Parallax. This device introduced us to electronics, circuitry, block-
              programming, and real-world application through Computer Science.
            </p>

            <p>
              Following our FLiP projects, we were assigned another project in which we recorded
              data, designed a map, and presented our results. During the Spanning Map project,
              we learned about efficiency, reliability, cost, teamwork, and public speaking.
            </p>

            <p>
              As our last assignment of the semester, we used the ActivityBot 360° Robot Kit.
              Like the FLiP boards, these devices were donated by Parallax. They allowed us
              to interact with the world not only through components, but wheels. With this
              assignment, we were asked to come up with a task for our robot to accomplish,
              and make it happen through Blockly.
            </p>

            <p>
              As you can see, not only have we learned many new things, but we've also had
              opportunities that we can never replace. As you read this website, you will
              gain a greater insight into our experiences.
            </p>
